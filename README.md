## 🎯 Objective

To predict thyroid disease conditions using classification models and compare performance across multiple techniques.

---

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Class imbalance is a challenge — precision/recall matter more than accuracy
- Random Forest and XGBoost showed better generalisation
- Preprocessing significantly improved model robustness
